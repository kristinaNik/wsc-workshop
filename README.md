About
-----

Welcome to the Developing headless e-commerce with Sylius and API Platform workshop!

This repository contains a pre-installed Sylius-Standard installation and will be used as main play ground for our Workshop.
This workshop contains 10 tasks - called adventures. Each adventure is described in the `\App\Tests\Api\AdventuresTest` class as a single test.
During the workshop we will uncomment one test at the given moment of time and try to make them green âœ…. Once this will be achieved
you may either start code refactoring or go to the next task.

Have fun!
